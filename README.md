# Machine_Learning_Guide
This repository is my personal approach to create a GiHub Repository that lists and explains major Machine Learning Preprocessing steps, algorithms/ models and evaluation techniques as simple as possible.

My main goal is to summarise the key aspects of practical machine learning techniques to decode the `black boxes` of algorithms, so that they are easy to understand.

I also want to showcase how I understand various machine learning algorithms and how to use their mathmatical foundation for model tuning. 

The knowledge consolidated in this repository is the foundation for all Kaggle Competitions I took part in, as well as personal ML projects - which are uploaded in the Kaggle repository.
