# Machine_Learning_Guide
This repository is a comprehensive guide to machine learning, covering both theory and practical implementations. It is structured to help to understand algorithms conceptually and see how they work in real-world projects. Each method is explained in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook and applied to a project in a Python script.
## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders, each focusing on a major machine learning category. Each folder includes:
- Jupyter Notebooks: Detailed explanations of the algorithms, including theoretical insights, equations, and visualizations.
- Python Scripts (.py): Practical applications of the algorithms on specific projects.
