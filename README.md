# Machine_Learning_Guide
This repository is a comprehensive guide to machine learning, covering both theory and practical implementations. It is structured to help learners and practitioners understand algorithms conceptually and see how they work in real-world projects. Each method is explained in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook and applied to a project in a Python script.
## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders, each focusing on a major machine learning category. Each folder includes:
	•	Jupyter Notebooks: Detailed explanations of the algorithms, including theoretical insights, equations, and visualizations.
	•	Python Scripts (.py): Practical applications of the algorithms on specific projects.

Current Content
	1.	Regression
	•	Simple Linear Regression: Theory and application.
	•	Multiple Linear Regression: Theory and application.

Coming Soon
	2.	Classification
	•	Algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Regression Trees.
	3.	Linear Classification
	•	Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multiclass Predictions.
	4.	Clustering
	•	Algorithms: K-Means Clustering and others.
